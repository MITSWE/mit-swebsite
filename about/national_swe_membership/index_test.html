        <h1>National SWE Membership</h1>
        <p>Registering as a national SWE member will broaden and enrich your SWE experience! As a registered national SWE member at MIT, you gain access to members-only events including leadership experiences, scholarships, career opportunities, social events,  support systems, and more. It is also important to join SWE as a national member because only then can you be recognized as a SWE member by MIT, SWE, and outside employers. Additionally, only registered national SWE members can run for SWE Board and Exec positions within MIT SWE.</p>
