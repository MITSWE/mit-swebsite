v1.4.0
    +Added new schema for passing values on the binding methods, which is really string against unescaped chars and works flawlessly using an array where you may choose the variable name and the html element to take the value from
    Example
        bindInline("compute_sum",array('a' => "number1", 'b' => "number2")) where a is the variable name, and "number1" is the html element to take the value from.
            or using static values
        bindInline("print_static",array('counter' => "hidden_counter", '_static' => $output)) where _static is the variable name ( underscore _ means it's static ) and $output is the value.
    +Fixed bug with timers and subsequent requests
    +Added more PHP Custom Errors when illegal values are used in AjaxCore's methods
    +Added PHP Custom Warning when deprecated methods are used. To keep using the class with deprecated methods, please change the error reporting on the top of the class to E_NONE
