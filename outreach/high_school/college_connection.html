			<h3>About</h3>

			<p>College Connection is a premiere college counseling and e-mentoring program for young women across the nation. Started by the MIT Society of Women Engineers, our mission is to encourage high school females to pursue higher education and to empower them to reach their full potential.

			<br><br>We provide one-on-one mentorship for all of our students and pair them with inspiring females at MIT. Whatever you are interested in, we are sure to have a mentor who shares what you love and can give you advice on how to get where you want to be. Our goal is to demystify the college application process and make college equally accessible to all students.

			<br><br><b>What is College Connection?</b><br><br>
			We are an e-mentoring program for female high school seniors who would like to connect with inspiring MIT students who can provide college application advice, financial aid help, and answers and advice to any questions you may have. We're here to help you any way we can!
			<br><br>
			<b>How is the program structured?</b><br><br>
			Mentees will converse with their paired mentor once a week over video chat and maintain email correspodance. Each meeting will be arranged based on the schedules of both the mentor and the mentee. Meetings will be held for a loose 30 minute time period, but feel free to extend your conversation if the two of you would like to. Similarly, mentors and mentees are free to meet more than the recommended number of times based on each pair's preference.
			<br><br>
			<b>Who can join College Connection?</b><br><br>
			We are primarily reaching out to young females in their senior year of high school who reside in less privileged areas and who do not have sufficient college counseling programs offered to them already. If you feel like you fit the profile that we're looking for, go ahead and sign up! Even if you're not sure, feel free to sign up anyway so we can see if we would be a good fit for us!
			<br><br>
			<b>How are mentors and mentees matched?</b><br><br>
			Based on your indicated interests in the sign-up form (for example, potential major, potential career path, hobbies, etc.), we will match you with a mentor who shares many of the same interests. Your mentor will also be able to answer many of the questions you will have. After a mentor and mentee have been matched, we will send both of you an email so you can introduce yourselves to each other, and schedule a time for the initial conversation. You will be able to ask any questions you have on your mind, and find a time that works for both of you to have regular conversations with your mentor.
			<br><br>
			<b>What can I ask my mentor about?</b><br><br>
			Anything! All mentors will be put through training before being assigned to any mentees. This training will focus on the college application process, financial aid application process, essay reviewing, and more so your mentors will be fully knowledgeable about any questions you may have.
			Of course, you may also ask your mentor about anything else you are interested in. They're here to act as an older sister to you and help you clarify any questions you may have.
			<br><br>
