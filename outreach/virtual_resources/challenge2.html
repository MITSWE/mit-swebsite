      <h2 style="text-align: center;">SWE Challenge 2: Make a Science Photography Portfolio!</h2>
      <br/>
            <p><b>Recommended age:</b> 10 - 15 years old</p>
            <p><b>Goal: </b>  Create a portfolio of awesome scientific principles using a phone camera and household objects. Let‚Äôs go!</p>
			<p>Estimated time: 45 minutes</p>
			<p>Prize Deadline: 
        <b><a href="https://forms.gle/PsRbLibUfqxTNNw77">Fill out our survey</a> by 
        November 30, 2020</b> to be entered in a raffle
        for some fun prizes!</p>
      <br/>

      <h3>‚úÇÔ∏è Materials</h3>
      <p>Phone Camera</p>
      <p>Household Objects including (these are just examples, use whatever you find!):</p>      
       <ul>
         <li>Fork</li>
         <li>CD</li>
         <li>Oil, Water, Food Coloring</li>
         <li>Sunglasses</li>
         <li>Pepper, dish soap</li>
         <li>Spoon</li>
         <li>Comb</li>
       </ul>

      <h3>üìå Introduction</h3>
      <p>Photographs are everywhere and can be used to capture amazing images from people to places, to food and nature. In this SWE challenge we will be using a phone camera and household objects to learn about scientific principles while also having fun! Below you will find different photographs to take and hopefully have some fun learning in the process!</p>

      <br/>
      
<h3>üì∏ Photographs to Take (20 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 1: Experiment with Shadows</h4>
<p>Shadows are created whenever something blocks a light source making it darker in that area! Try to take a picture of a shadow by holding some object like a fork between a light source and the subject of your picture. Here‚Äôs an example taken by one of our SWE Challenge members of a fork and some eggs! 
</p><br>
<img style="padding-bottom: 20px;" src="challenges_shadows.png" width="25%" height="25%">

<br />
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 2: CD Rainbows</h4>
<p>CDs have a mirrored surface and are able to create rainbows in the room when direct light is shone on them. Try finding a CD in the house and going near a bright light source - do you see the rainbows coming off of it? Take a cool picture of the phenomenon and check out the link <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question52.htm">here</a> to learn more about the science </p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 3: Sunglasses Filter</h4>
<p>We use sunglasses to protect our eyes because they are able to filter the light that passes through them and change what makes it to our eyes. Why not try to see how that looks in a picture? Find a pair of sunglasses and shoot a picture through the lens. See what cool shots you can get! They will likely be colored differently than what you see with your own eyes because they might be tinted. </p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 4: Oil and Water</h4>
<p>Now we‚Äôll move into the kitchen! Find a bowl and some oil (like vegetable, canola, or olive oil for instance.) Pour some water into the bowl and then add a little bit of oil. If you want, add some food dye to the oil. You‚Äôll notice that the oil forms colored bubbles and floats in the water rather than being combined in it. This is due to the chemistry of the water and oil molecules not being attracted to each other. Take a picture of your favorite design you get!</p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 5: Pepper and Soap</h4>
<p>Fill a small bowl about halfway with some water, then sprinkle in some pepper so that it's distributed evenly across the surface. You should notice that, like the oil, the pepper floats on the water. Now, take a toothpick and put some dish soap on the tip. Poke the tip with the soap on it into the center of the bowl. What happens? You should see the pepper flakes suddenly go to the sides of the bowl. This is because at first, there is surface tension that causes the pepper to float, but the soap breaks the surface tension so that the water moves away from the soap, bringing the pepper with it. See what cool designs you can photograph.</p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 6: Balance a Spoon</h4>
<p>Grab a spoon and try to balance it on your finger. Which part of the spoon should you place on your finger so that it balances? Move the spoon around until it balances on your finger and take a picture. You'll probably find that the ideal spot is not in the middle of the spoon, but closer to the eating part of the spoon. This is because there is more material on that end, making that side have more mass. As a result, the center of mass is shifted towards the eating end. If you need help taking this picture, get a family member to help!</p><br>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Image 7: Bending Water with a Comb</h4>
<p>Now head over to a sink. Take a comb and run it through your hair several times, for about 15 seconds. While doing this, turn on the faucet so that there's a small stream of water coming out. Now, bring the teeth of the comb close to the stream of water, a few inches below the faucet. You should see the water bend towards the comb! Take a picture of this phenomenon. This is a result of static electricity. When you run the comb through your hair, negatively charged electrons are collected on the comb. Since water has both positive and negative charges, the positive charges are attracted to the negative charges on the comb, bringing the water closer to the comb.
</p><br>

<h3>‚úèÔ∏è Write an Artist's Statement (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>
    In museums and art galleries, you will often find plaques on the walls with descriptions about the art piece for viewers to learn more. Pick your favorite photograph that you have taken and write a 5 sentence artist statement. Some things to include are materials used to make the image, how you made the image, and why you like the image. Don‚Äôt forget to give your image a title! 
</p>

<br/>

<h3>üéä Share your favorite image and statement! (10 minutes)</h3>
